# json-sync-server
Simple HTTP server that allows all clients to sync a single JSON object. This came up while developing a browser extension that needs to sync its settings between clients without having the server care about the underlying structure of the configuration. This is intended for development purposes and is about the most basic implementation imaginable (in other words, please do not expose this to the internet without proper security precautions).
